Social Sciences Track:  Carolina Data Challenge 


An analysis of how US cities' demographics changed from 2000 to 2010. Because different areas of the country are made of distinct groups of people, not every place demands the same needs. We make conclusions based on this data on where it would be best to invest specific resources and allocate certain funds and services.

Included in this repository is an RMD file containing our data-cleaning process in R Studio and our Tableau Workbook. We have also included our final slides for the judged oral presentation and the Excel file which contains original data and some work we did on it. Ultimately, this project won 1st place at Carolina Data Challenge 2023.


The first and third files are Tableau Workbooks. The second are the presentation slides. The fifth is the excel file. And finally, the last file is the R Markdown file. Thank you for taking your time to view our project!
